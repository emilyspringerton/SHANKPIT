scripts/rl_league.py -- AlphaStar-style league training checkpoint registry, S459-35, ported
verbatim a SECOND time (BRAWLPIT/scripts/rl_league.py -> here) -- founder real-time: "ALSO WE NEED
BOT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SHANKPIT JUST LIKE WE HAVE FOR BRAWLPIT - THE LEAGUE set up the same
registry plumbing for shankpit." Zero game-specific coupling anywhere in this file (pure Python,
generic checkpoint paths -- LeagueManager/LeagueRole/PFSP math never reference any specific game
type), confirmed directly before reusing rather than reimplementing, matching the same real
"reuse verbatim" precedent BRAWLPIT's own copy of this file already documents (itself ported from
REDGARDEN/scripts/rl_league.py, and ECOWAR's own apps/arena_training/src/headless.c the same way).

Real, honest, checked-not-assumed status for THIS repo specifically: SHANKPIT has NO RL training
loop anywhere yet -- `apps2/emily-bot` (this repo's own real, packet-level bot client, S459-34) is
fixed-heuristic only, there is no PPO trainer, no gym-shaped packet env (BRAWLPIT's own
`scripts/rl_env_packet.py`, 1200+ lines, is that missing piece there), and therefore no real
checkpoints for this registry to ever hold. Committing this file makes the REGISTRY plumbing real
and ready (`LeagueManager.register`/`sample_for_main`/`sample_for_main_exploiter`/
`sample_for_league_exploiter`, one append-only JSON file per checkpoint under `<league_dir>/
members/`) -- it does NOT make SHANKPIT bots learned. A real training loop (the actual
prerequisite before this registry has anything to register) is separate, substantial, scoped
future work, named here rather than silently implied done. See REDGARDEN/NORTHSTAR.md §25.4.1 for
the full original design doc and rationale; not re-derived here.

Original module doc, unchanged below (still accurate -- "NORTHSTAR §25.4"/"§25.4.1" below refer
to REDGARDEN's own NORTHSTAR.md, the doc this design was ported from):

scripts/rl_league.py -- AlphaStar-style league training, a real, additive extension of NORTHSTAR
§25.4's existing PFSP autocurriculum (see §25.4.1 for the full design doc).

Founder real-time direction, citing a real, named source (a YouTube explainer of DeepMind's own
AlphaStar league, timestamps 13:01-13:55): §25.4's existing autocurriculum is plain PFSP against
ONE policy's own growing checkpoint pool -- exactly the "simple self-play" the video names as
vulnerable to CYCLIC DOMINANCE (a rock-paper-scissors dynamic: training against your current self
makes you better against that one opponent while quietly getting worse against others). AlphaStar's
own real fix is a LEAGUE of three distinct agent roles trained simultaneously, each contributing
permanent, never-evicted checkpoints back into one shared pool:

  - MAIN: trains against the whole league (PFSP-weighted, biased toward whatever it currently
    loses to most) -- pushes the skill frontier forward, same real objective §25.4's own single
    policy already has, just sampling from a shared multi-lineage pool instead of only its own
    history.
  - MAIN_EXPLOITER: has ONE job -- find and break Main's CURRENT weaknesses. Challenges Main's
    freshest checkpoint directly; if it can't win consistently (no learning signal, nothing to
    exploit yet), it "climbs down" to Main's own historical checkpoints instead, biased toward
    ones it can ALREADY beat (the opposite bias from standard PFSP) to build up real skill before
    re-challenging the current Main. Periodically resets to a freshly initialized network --
    prevents the exploiter itself from converging onto one narrow trick and forces it to
    rediscover exploits from scratch.
  - LEAGUE_EXPLOITER: same PFSP-weighted whole-league sampling as Main, but a SEPARATE lineage --
    its whole purpose is finding weaknesses that persist across the ENTIRE league (not just
    Main's current self), so nothing here ever holds a permanent blind spot as a group.

Real, honest, necessary scope note on "current Main": this repo trains each role as a SEPARATE
process (see rl_train_team.py's own --league-role flag and run_league.sh's own orchestration) --
there is no single shared in-memory model across processes. "Current Main" therefore means
Main's own most-recently-REGISTERED checkpoint on disk, re-read from the shared, file-based
LeagueManager registry each time it's needed, not literally the exact in-memory weights of a
live-training process at that instant. This is the real, honest tradeoff of a checkpoint-based
multi-process league (not a hack -- any file-based league without extra IPC would work this way),
named directly rather than silently smoothed over.

Every registered checkpoint is PERMANENT -- unlike §25.4's own existing MAX_CHECKPOINT_OPPONENTS=5
eviction, nothing here is ever removed from the league. Per-opponent win/loss stats used for PFSP
weighting stay LOCAL to whichever process is doing the sampling (same architecture §25.4's own
ArenaTeamVecEnv.opponent_wins/opponent_losses already uses -- each trainee's own experience against
an opponent is what should bias ITS OWN curriculum, not a globally-shared, harder-to-keep-correct
stat); only the REGISTRY of which checkpoints exist is shared across processes, via one small JSON
file per registration under <league_dir>/members/ -- append-only, so no locking is needed even
with three real concurrent writers (a new registration is always a brand-new file, never an
overwrite of another process's).
