 *
 * Real, confirmed-live bug fixed here (2026-08-27, founder actually
 * dropping a real large file onto the PARENA editor: "it crashed...
 * if we try to open a too large file it just chokes"): this used to
 * grow in FIXED 4096-byte chunks, reallocating (not resizing in
 * place -- this is a bump arena, the old buffer is never freed) and
 * copying the ENTIRE buffer so far on every single grow step. For an
 * N-byte file that's N/4096 grow steps, each copying up to N bytes --
 * real O(N^2) copy work, and since every intermediate buffer stays
 * permanently allocated (arena, not a real realloc), real O(N^2)
 * WASTED memory too: a 100MB file needs roughly 1.2TB of total arena
 * allocations across every intermediate step, not the 100MB anyone
 * would expect -- the real, confirmed root cause of "chokes"/crashes
 * on a large file, not a vague performance concern.
 *
 * Fixed with the real, obvious right answer for a REGULAR FILE
 * specifically (raw-read-all's only real caller, io.prn's own
 * read-string, is documented as FileHandle-only): fstat(2) the real
 * file size up front and allocate that in ONE shot -- zero grow
 * steps, zero wasted intermediate buffers, for the real common case.
 * fstat can still be wrong (the file grows while being read, or a
 * non-regular fd somehow reaches here) -- real doubling growth (not
 * the old fixed +4096) is kept as the real fallback for exactly that
 * case, so this stays correct even when the size hint is, not just
 * fast when it's right.
 *
 * Real, confirmed-live SECOND bug found and fixed here (2026-08-28,
 * founder real-time: "when i open a large file its dog shit slow we
 * dont want to load the whole thing into memory"): the fast path
 * above (fstat succeeded) was STILL silently paying for a full extra
 * copy of the whole file. Root cause, confirmed via direct
 * instrumentation against a real 119MB test file (cap ended up
 * EXACTLY 2x the real file size -- one full, needless doubling, not
 * the "zero grow steps" the fstat fast path was supposed to
 * guarantee): a real EOF can only ever be detected by actually
 * calling read() with a NONZERO size and getting 0 back -- there is
 * no way to know "the file has no more bytes" without asking. A cap
 * sized to EXACTLY st_size+1 leaves no room left for that one
 * confirming call once every real content byte has been read, so the
 * old code (any version that tries to guarantee room for a real
 * read() request right up to the exact byte) is forced to grow the
 * WHOLE buffer just to make room for one call that's going to return
 * 0 bytes anyway.
 *
 * Real fix: size `cap` with `st_size + 4097` instead of `st_size + 1`
 * -- the real content, PLUS one full extra 4096-byte read-chunk's
 * worth of headroom (so the loop can always make one more real,
 * nonzero-sized read attempt right at the true end and get back a
 * real EOF signal without ever needing to grow first), PLUS 1 for the
 * NUL terminator. 4096 bytes of slack is negligible next to any file
 * large enough for this to matter (0.003% of the 119MB test file),
 * and the growth check itself (`len + 4096 >= cap`) can never fire
 * while reading real content anymore, since cap is always at least
 * 4096 bytes ahead of the real file size. A real `grew` flag (not an
 * exact `cap == len + 1` size comparison, which the 4097-byte slack
 * would always fail even in the genuinely no-growth case) tracks
 * whether a real overshoot doubling ever actually happened -- only
 * then is the trim-copy below real, needed work; the ordinary case

 * PITVIPER's own real font backend (cmd/pitviper/main.go's shinyTexture,

 * carried as a struct field is untested territory in this compiler, not
 * risked here).
 *
 * render-text is deliberately NOT a glyph-atlas/texture-cache system --
 * a real, honest v0: render the whole string to a fresh surface, blit
 * it, free both surface and texture immediately, every call. Correct,
 * simple, and reuses zero state across frames; real future work once an
