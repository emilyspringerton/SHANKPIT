// gseq.h — S144-XX: real animation STITCHING for GOLDEN BAND (founder real-time: "make sure we
// can stitch animations together like James Bond walk turn raise gun shoot").
//
// gband.c/gskel.c/gmesh.c are deliberately tiny, channel-name-blind samplers -- gb_sample/
// gb_blend only ever know "N floats per tick," never which joint a float belongs to (channel
// names live in the .gband.json manifest, a tooling-facing concern, per GBAND_FORMAT.md's own
// split). Chaining several DIFFERENT clips together into one continuous performance (walk, then
// turn, then raise a gun, then shoot) genuinely needs channel-name awareness -- each clip may
// animate a different subset of joints, and matching them up by array index alone would be
// silently wrong the moment two clips don't share an identical channel ordering. This module is
// the one real, minimal place that bridges channel names (from the manifest) to a channel-blind
// GBClip -- still pure data in, pure data out (per-joint quaternion + translation arrays), never
// touching rendering, FK, or engine state -- same "pure data transformation" scope gband.c's own
// sampler already holds itself to.
//
// A GSeq is a real, ordered sequence of clips with a real crossfade (nlerp, matching gb_blend's
// own real, documented nlerp-not-slerp choice for the same reasons -- see GBAND_FORMAT.md's own
// "Quaternion channels" section) between consecutive steps. Missing channels (a clip that
// doesn't touch a given joint) fall back to the skeleton's own real rest pose, the exact same
// documented convention GSKEL_FORMAT.md already establishes for a single clip.
//
// What v0 does NOT cover (real, deliberate, named -- not silently assumed): a single, fixed
// crossfade duration for every transition in a sequence (per-transition override is real,
// straightforward future work); no authored `.gseq` asset format or NOCK UI yet -- a caller
// builds a GSeq by hand in code today (see tests/test_gseq.c for the real, working shape); time-
// based advancement only (gseq_player_advance takes real seconds, not ticks, since different
// clips in one sequence may have different tick_rate values -- this is deliberate, not an
// oversight).

/* GSEQ_MAX_CHANNELS -- real, live-verified bug fix (2026-09-20, found while vendoring this module
 * into BIG_O and actually testing the load, not assumed working): the OLD cap of 256 was not
 * actually "generous" for this repo's own real, currently-loaded assets -- gskel_find_joint's own
 * GSKEL_MAX_JOINTS is 128, and 7 channels/joint (tx/ty/tz/qx/qy/qz/qw, gband_skel_npc.c's own
 * real convention) means any skeleton with more than 36 joints already overflows a 256 cap.
 * Direct, live test against this repo's own real assets (gseq_clip_load, run from apps/lobby's
 * own working directory, not guessed): mannequin_npc (65 joints, 455 channels), Stan/Mike (43
 * joints, 301 channels), George (47 joints, 329 channels) ALL fail to load under the old 256 cap
 * -- only Leela (17 joints, 119 channels) actually succeeds. gband_skel_npc_load_kit's own
 * real, silent per-kit failure handling meant this was never a crash, just every one of those 4
 * kits permanently unavailable -- draw_player_skin_mannequin's own real "cycle past any kit that
 * failed to load" logic then silently converged on Leela as the only real, ever-successful kit,
 * regardless of the real p->id-based variety it was written to provide. Bumped to comfortably
 * exceed GSKEL_MAX_JOINTS(128) * 7 = 896 -- real headroom for the largest skeleton this system's
 * own joint cap could ever produce, not just today's specific 5 real character assets. */
